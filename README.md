## aircraft_localization_competition

#### Description of the files:

Jupyter notebook **Aircraft localization competition. Part 1. Exploratory analysis and a simple solution.ipynb** does NOT relate to the final solution and therefore can be skipped. It provides some insights about data and includes a simple solution which showed accuracy of 425m on the leaderboard. 

Jupyter notebook **Aircraft localization competition. Part 2. Final solution.ipynb** includes full solution for round 1 of the competition.

Additional files **test_preprocessed_solution.csv** and **base_points_solution.csv** contain intermediate results, which can be used to separately check / understand different parts of the solution. File **test_preprocessed_solution.csv** includes results of step 2; file **base_points_solution.csv** includes results of step 3.
